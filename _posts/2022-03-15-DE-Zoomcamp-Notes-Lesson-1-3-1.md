## Introduction to Terraform Concepts and GCP Pre-Requisites.

This lesson was very straight forward. We went through these [steps](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/week_1_basics_n_setup/1_terraform_gcp/2_gcp_overview.md#initial-setup) for the initial setup in GCP.
  - For step 4 (Download SDK for local setup) I needed to follow these [step](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/week_1_basics_n_setup/1_terraform_gcp/windows.md) because I am working with windows.
