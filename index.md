I am a former statistics professor at a small liberal arts college, who voluntarily left to move back 'home'. I am currently exploring different career pivots. These include roles such as becoming a Data Engineer, Data Analyst, or Data Scientist.

Currently, my posts are focusing on my progress learning more about becoming a Data Engineer and the tools required to land such a role. I am using DataTalksClub's [Data Engineering Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp) as my guide.
